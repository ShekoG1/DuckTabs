# Privacy Policy for DuckTabs

## Introduction

Welcome to DuckTabs! We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your data is handled responsibly. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

### Tabs Information

DuckTabs only collects information about the tabs that are currently open in your browser. This data includes the URLs of these tabs, which are used solely for the purpose of managing and storing your tab groups.

## How We Use Your Information

1. **Tab Management**: The URLs of your open tabs are stored to allow you to create, save, and manage tab groups. This enables you to restore these tabs later or switch between different groups of tabs.
   
2. **Group Operations**: We use the tab URLs to facilitate operations such as saving, opening, and deleting tab groups as requested by you.

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage**: All data related to your tab groups is stored locally on your device using the Chrome extension's storage API. This data is not transmitted to external servers or third parties.
  
- **Data Encryption**: While your data is stored locally, we use best practices to ensure it is kept secure. This includes encoding URLs to prevent data corruption.

## Third-Party Access

DuckTabs does not share, sell, or transfer your data to any third parties. Your information is solely used within the extension to provide its functionalities.

## Data Retention

Your tab group data will remain stored on your device as long as you keep the DuckTabs extension installed. You can delete tab groups at any time, and all related data will be removed from your local storage.

## User Rights

- **Access**: You have the right to view and manage your tab groups directly within the DuckTabs extension.
- **Deletion**: You can delete any tab groups or clear all data stored by DuckTabs through the extensionâ€™s interface.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted here, and we encourage you to review this policy periodically.
